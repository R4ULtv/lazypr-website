## Overview

LazyPR is a command-line tool that automatically generates professional pull request titles and descriptions by analyzing your git commits using AI. It eliminates the tedious task of writing PR descriptions manually, saving time while maintaining consistency and quality.

## The Problem

Writing good pull requests is time-consuming:

- **Manual effort**: Developers spend 5-10 minutes per PR summarizing changes
- **Inconsistent quality**: PR descriptions vary wildly between team members
- **Context switching**: Breaking coding flow to write documentation
- **Repetitive work**: Explaining the same commits you already wrote

## The Solution

LazyPR automates PR creation in seconds:

```bash
lazypr main
```

That's it. LazyPR analyzes your commits, understands the changes, and generates a professional PR with:
- A clear, concise title following conventional commits
- Structured description with bullet points
- Testing information derived from your commits
- Proper formatting ready to paste into GitHub

## How It Works

1. **Analyze Commits**: LazyPR reads all commits between your feature branch and target branch
2. **Smart Filtering**: Automatically excludes merge commits, dependency updates, and noise
3. **AI Generation**: Sends commit data to your chosen provider (cloud or local AI)
4. **Professional Output**: Receives a formatted PR title and description
5. **Easy Copy**: Interactive menu to copy to clipboard or create PR directly

## Key Benefits

### Save Time

Generate PRs in **10-15 seconds** instead of 5-10 minutes. For teams creating multiple PRs daily, that's hours saved per week.

### Consistent Quality

Every PR follows the same professional format, making code reviews faster and more efficient.

### Team Collaboration

International teams can generate PRs in 13 different languages while maintaining the same structure.

### Focus on Coding

Spend less time documenting and more time building. LazyPR handles the PR writing so you can stay in flow.
