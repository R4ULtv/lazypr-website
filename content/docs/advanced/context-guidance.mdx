## What is Context?

Context is custom style guidance you provide to influence how LazyPR generates PR descriptions. It's like giving the AI a "personality" or "instructions" for writing PRs.

Maximum length: **200 characters**

## Setting Global Context

Configure context that applies to all PR generations:

```bash
lazypr config set CONTEXT="Use conventional commits format and keep descriptions concise"
```

Every time you run `lazypr`, this guidance influences the output.

## Per-Run Context

Override global context for a single generation:

```bash
lazypr main -c "Focus on security improvements"
lazypr main -c "Emphasize performance benefits"
lazypr main -c "Keep it brief, max 3 bullet points"
```

Per-run context takes precedence over global context.

## Effective Context Examples

### Focus on Style

```bash
# Concise, bullet-point style
lazypr main -c "Keep descriptions concise with bullet points"

# Detailed explanations
lazypr main -c "Provide detailed explanations for each change"

# Technical focus
lazypr main -c "Use technical terminology and avoid simplification"
```

### Emphasize Specific Aspects

```bash
# Business value
lazypr main -c "Emphasize business value and user impact"

# Technical implementation
lazypr main -c "Focus on technical implementation details"

# Testing and quality
lazypr main -c "Highlight testing approach and quality improvements"
```

### Audience-Specific

```bash
# Non-technical stakeholders
lazypr main -c "Write for non-technical stakeholders"

# Senior developers
lazypr main -c "Assume senior developer audience"

# Product managers
lazypr main -c "Focus on product features and user value"
```

### Team Standards

```bash
# Conventional commits
lazypr main -c "Follow conventional commits specification"

# Include ticket numbers
lazypr main -c "Reference ticket numbers and user stories"

# Testing requirements
lazypr main -c "Always mention testing strategy"
```

## Context Best Practices

### Be Specific

**Good** (specific):
```bash
"Focus on security improvements and mention any vulnerabilities addressed"
```

**Less effective** (vague):
```bash
"Make it good"
```

### Keep It Short

Remember the 200-character limit. Be concise:

**Good** (concise):
```bash
"Emphasize performance gains and include metrics"
```

**Too long**:
```bash
"I want you to really emphasize the performance gains we've made and include specific metrics wherever possible and also mention any trade-offs we had to make and explain the reasoning behind technical decisions"
```

### Match Your Team's Voice

Analyze your team's existing PRs and create context that matches:

```bash
# Formal, corporate
lazypr main -c "Professional tone, formal language"

# Casual, startup
lazypr main -c "Casual tone, focus on impact"

# Technical, open-source
lazypr main -c "Technical detail, community-friendly"
```

## Examples with Output

### Without Context

```bash
lazypr main
```

**Output**:
```markdown
feat: Add user authentication

## Changes
- Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication flow
- Add JWT token management
- Create login and logout endpoints
- Add session persistence
```

### With "Keep it brief" Context

```bash
lazypr main -c "Keep descriptions very brief, max 3 points"
```

**Output**:
```markdown
feat: Add user authentication

## Changes
- Implement OAuth 2.0 flow
- Add JWT token management
- Create authentication endpoints
```

### With "Business focus" Context

```bash
lazypr main -c "Emphasize business value and user impact"
```

**Output**:
```markdown
feat: Add user authentication

## Changes
- Enable secure user login via OAuth 2.0, improving security and user trust
- Implement session management for seamless user experience
- Support multiple OAuth providers, increasing user convenience

## Impact
Provides enterprise-grade security while reducing friction in the login process.
```

### With "Technical detail" Context

```bash
lazypr main -c "Include technical implementation details"
```

**Output**:
```markdown
feat: Add user authentication

## Changes
- Implement OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow with PKCE
- Add JWT token generation using RS256 algorithm
- Create RESTful endpoints: POST /auth/login, POST /auth/logout
- Implement Redis-based session store with 24h TTL
```

## Common Use Cases

### Security PRs

```bash
lazypr main -c "Highlight security improvements and vulnerabilities fixed"
```

### Performance PRs

```bash
lazypr main -c "Focus on performance gains with specific metrics"
```

### Refactoring PRs

```bash
lazypr main -c "Explain refactoring rationale and benefits"
```

### Bug Fix PRs

```bash
lazypr main -c "Describe the bug, root cause, and fix approach"
```

## Combining with Other Features

Context works alongside other LazyPR features:

```bash
# Context + Template + Language
lazypr main --template -l es -c "Enfoque en seguridad"

# Context + GitHub CLI + Token usage
lazypr main --gh -c "Keep it brief" -u
```

## Managing Context

### View Current Context

```bash
lazypr config get CONTEXT
```

### Clear Context

Remove global context:

```bash
lazypr config set CONTEXT=""
```

Or just use per-run context to override:

```bash
lazypr main -c "Different guidance for this PR"
```

## Limitations

**Character limit**: 200 characters maximum. LazyPR truncates longer context.

**Not instructions**: Context is guidance, not strict instructions. The AI interprets context creatively.

**Commit-dependent**: Output quality still depends on your commit messages. Great context can't fix vague commits.

<Callout type="warn">
  Context influences but doesn't guarantee specific output. Review and edit generated PRs as needed.
</Callout>

## Tips for Success

1. **Experiment**: Try different context styles to see what works for your team
2. **Iterate**: Refine your context based on results
3. **Be consistent**: Use similar context for similar types of PRs
4. **Combine approaches**: Use global context for team standards, per-run for special cases
5. **Document**: Share effective context examples with your team

## Troubleshooting

**Context not working**: Ensure your context is clear and specific. Vague guidance produces minimal change.

**Output too different**: Your context may be too prescriptive. Try more general guidance.

**Character limit**: If truncated, prioritize the most important guidance first.
